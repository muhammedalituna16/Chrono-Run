# Chrono-Run
Chrono Run's concept is like endless runner games, but it's enriched with progression through time and era-specific elements.

Players could start in prehistoric times, hurling stones at dinosaurs, and as they progress, move into the medieval era to battle with swords, later gaining access to modern and futuristic weaponry, such as lightsabers. Throughout the game, the player would have a health bar to manage while combating enemies and accumulating points for the scoreboard.

Delving deeper into the game's details:

Gameplay: The player needs to overcome constantly changing obstacles and avoid enemies. The obstacles and enemies will be specific to the era the player is currently in.
Time Periods: The game would start in prehistoric times and progress through various historical periods. Each period would introduce new obstacles, enemies, and weapons for the player to use.

Weapons and Enemies: Each period would feature different weapons for the player to use and different types of enemies to confront. For example, the prehistoric period would have rocks and clubs, the medieval period would have swords and armor, and the future period would include lightsabers and energy guns.

Health and Score System: The player would have a health bar that decreases when clashing with enemies or hitting obstacles. Health can be replenished by collecting certain items or defeating enemies. Progress and defeating enemies would also contribute to the player's score.

End: The game would end with a "Game Over" screen, but players would be encouraged to play again to beat their or others' scores.
